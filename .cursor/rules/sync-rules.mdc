# Rule Synchronization

**CRITICAL**: Every rule change or creation MUST be applied to BOTH directories:

- `.cursor/rules/` (Cursor IDE rules, `.mdc` extension)
- `.claude/rules/` (Claude Code rules, `.md` extension)

## When Creating a New Rule

1. Create the rule in `.cursor/rules/<rule-name>.mdc`
2. Create the same rule in `.claude/rules/<rule-name>.md`
3. Content should be identical (only the frontmatter format differs slightly)

## When Modifying an Existing Rule

1. Apply the change to `.cursor/rules/<rule-name>.mdc`
2. Apply the same change to `.claude/rules/<rule-name>.md`

## When Deleting a Rule

1. Delete from `.cursor/rules/`
2. Delete from `.claude/rules/`

## File Format Differences

- **Cursor**: Uses `.mdc` extension with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`)
- **Claude**: Uses `.md` extension with similar frontmatter structure

The rule content after the frontmatter should be identical in both files.
