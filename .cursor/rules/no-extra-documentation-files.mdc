# No Extra Documentation Files

## Rule: Do Not Create Unnecessary Documentation Files

**NEVER** create the following documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user:

- `README.md` (except at project root if it doesn't exist)
- `SUMMARY.md`
- `VALIDATION.md`
- `NOTES.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (unless maintaining an existing one)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Any other meta-documentation files

## Why This Rule Exists

Creating extra documentation files:

- Clutters the codebase with redundant information
- Creates maintenance burden (files get out of sync)
- Distracts from actual implementation work
- Often duplicates information already in code or existing docs

## What You SHOULD Do Instead

### For OpenSpec Proposals

Only create these required files:

- `proposal.md` - The proposal document
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist
- `design.md` - Only when architectural decisions need discussion
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md` - The specification deltas

### For Features

- Write clear code comments and JSDoc
- Update existing documentation if it exists
- Create documentation only when explicitly asked

### For Project Documentation

- Only update existing documentation files
- Do not create new top-level docs without explicit request
- Prefer in-code documentation over separate files

## Exceptions

You MAY create documentation files when:

1. **User explicitly asks**: "Create a README for this feature"
2. **Convention requires it**: Package needs a README.md for npm
3. **Updating existing file**: File already exists and needs updates
4. **Standard project structure**: Creating initial project structure

## Examples

❌ **BAD** - Creating unsolicited docs:

```
Created files:
- feature.ts
- feature.test.ts
- README.md          ← NEVER do this without being asked
- IMPLEMENTATION.md  ← NEVER do this without being asked
```

✅ **GOOD** - Only creating requested files:

```
Created files:
- feature.ts
- feature.test.ts
```

❌ **BAD** - Creating summary docs for OpenSpec:

```
openspec/changes/my-feature/
├── proposal.md
├── tasks.md
├── specs/feature/spec.md
├── README.md        ← NEVER create this
└── SUMMARY.md       ← NEVER create this
```

✅ **GOOD** - Only OpenSpec required files:

```
openspec/changes/my-feature/
├── proposal.md
├── tasks.md
├── design.md (only if needed)
└── specs/feature/spec.md
```

## Summary

**Default behavior**: Do NOT create documentation files.

**Only create docs when**: User explicitly requests them.

**Keep it simple**: Code + comments + existing docs is usually enough.
